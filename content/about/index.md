I'm Evan! I'm a _machine learning researcher_, a _software developer_, and I specialize in the field of _natural language processing_ and _deep learning_. I was able to publish _two machine/deep learning research papers in scopus-indexed conferences_.

I've worked with a variety of major programming languages such as _Python, C#, and Javascript_ as well as their associated libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow+Keras for AI, C#’s ASP.NET, and the React+Redux stack among many others. I've also worked with DevOps and deployment jobs involving continuous integration with Docker, Kubernetes, and Gitlab CI.

Outside of work, I'm also a board game enthusiast (eurogames!), a home cook, a graphic designer, and someone aspiring to learn Japanese and Mandarin (こんにちは! 你好!).
