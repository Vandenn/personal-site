I'm Evan! I'm a **machine learning researcher**, a **software developer**, and I specialize in the field of **natural language processing** and **deep learning**. I've published **two machine/deep learning research papers in scopus-indexed conferences**.

I've worked with a variety of major programming languages such as **Python, C#, and Javascript** as well as their associated libraries, including PyTorch and TensorFlow+Keras for AI, C#’s ASP.NET, and the React+Redux stack, among many others. I've also worked with DevOps and deployment jobs involving continuous integration with Docker, Kubernetes, and Gitlab CI.

Outside of work, I'm also a board game enthusiast (eurogames!), a home cook, a graphic designer, and someone aspiring to learn Japanese and Mandarin (こんにちは! 你好!).
